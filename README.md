# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction
In this Repository, I have created a supervised Machine Learning model for the Prediction of Prices of Houses using Scikit-Learn
The environment used by me for this project is Jupyter Notebook.
Concepts used : cross validation, train-test splitting, stratified shuffle split, cross validation and sampling work in action.
In this project I covered the analyzing of the problem from collecting data, importing it to a Jupyter notebook, looking for promising attributes, finding out correlations, plotting graphs, creating a pipeline and dealing with missing values.
